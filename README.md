# Advanced Monsters Datapack v.1.4.6

With the Advanced Monsters Datapack v.1.4.6 of 2mal3 there is a chance (usually 10%) that a monster will become an Advanced Monster. This monster has 50% more life, does 50% more damage, is 10% faster and sees players 10% longer.

The chance can be changed under data > amd > loot_tables > random.json by changing the second number. The probability then results from 1 / The specified number.

This datapack supports with my [Language Pack](http://adfoc.us/51488274991099) the languages German, Spanish and French.
