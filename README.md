# Advanced Monsters Datapack v1.3.0
Compatibility: Multiplayer 1.16+

This datapack adds the chance for normal monsters to become advanced monsters. These monsters are faster, stronger and have more lives, so the game becomes a bit more difficult.                                                                                       
That is all.

### Settings:
The command: `scoreboard players set $admo.transform_chance admo.data <number>` can be used to set the probability of spawning the advanced monsters.                                                                                                                     
The probability is calculated with **1 / the set number**. Example: If you set as the number 20 the probability is 5% (1/20=0.05=5%).
If the number is 1, every monster is advanced.                                                                                        
If the number is 0, no monster is advanced.
